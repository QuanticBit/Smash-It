Smash-It
========

Smash It is a simple multiplayer brawl game from 2 up to 4 players that can battle with their customized skin and on their own map
When the pc game will be finished, i'll plan to adapt it on mobile devices.

It's coded in Java without any library on a swing JFrame, with custom drawing with Graphics Object.
Currently not all classes are commented, it's what i'm currently wroking on.
